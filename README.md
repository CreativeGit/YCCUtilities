# YCC-Utilities
YCC Utilities Discord Bot.

# How To Use
- Create a new application at https://discord.com/developers/applications. Create a bot user for this application and copy the token (keep this safe!).
- Make sure you have Python >= 3.10 as well as the listed requirements installed (many are dependencies of discord.py).
- Open example.env and replace the example values with your own. Keep this file in the same directory as the main.py file. For environment variables that take a list of values, separate each value with only a comma.
- Run main.py.
