# YCC-Utilities
YCC Utilities Discord Bot.

# How To Use
- Create a new Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Create a bot user for this application and copy the token. Keep this sake and do not give it to anybody.
- Make sure you have Python >= 3.10 as well as the listed requirements installed. Many are dependencies of the `discord.py` library.
- Open `example.env` and replace the example values with your own. Keep this file in the same directory as the `main.py` file. For environment variables that take a list of values, separate each value with only a comma.
- Navigate into the YCC Utilities directory in your terminal and start the bot using `python3 main.py`.
